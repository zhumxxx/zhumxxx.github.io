Mingxuan Zhu is a third-year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/danhao/" target="_blank">Dan Hao</a> in Software Engineering Institute, School of Computer Science, Peking University. He received his B.S degree from Department of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University.

My research goal is to achieve software performance optimization, and software correctness. Specifically, to use automatic techniques to test the target software, or to improve the performance of the target software, including compiler auto-tuning, compiler testing, test case generation, etc.
